## Overview
The goal of this assignment is to implement a data integration application in RDF to get experience in 
data modeling and querying in RDF and in inference capabilities of RDF standards. 
Unlike the previous assignments, you will prepare your datasets from scratch. 
Specifically, you will prepare files that store the triples in your database as well as 
SPARQL queries that answer a set of questions, and a README file that contains written descriptions 
of you modeling choices.

## Scenario
Imaging you are at a company that has prepared two separate RDF databases about sports players and teams in the world 
and the venues of these teams. There are two separate databases, one about "Team Sports" and the other about 
"Individual Sports". Below are the descriptions of the data that is stored in these databases. 
Your goal will be to model this data in RDF. Do read through the descriptions of the databases as well as the queries, 
as the queries can affect your modeling choices.

### Team Sports Database:
This database stores information about the following entities and their relationshios:
- **Team sports:** There are 9 different team sports, which we will call "TSport_1", ..., "TSport_9" (think of these as football, basketball etc.) 
- **Clubs, Arenas, and Stadiums:** For each team sport TSport_i, there is 1 club "Club_i" that play under it.
  The 1-1 correspondence is for simplicity. In a more realistic setting, you would have more than 1 clubs under each team sport.
  Club_i has a name  "Tigers_i". Odd clubs Club_1, Club_3, ..., Club_9 have "arenas", Arena_1, ..., Arena_9.
  Even clubs Club_2, ..., Club_8 have "stadiums", "Stadium_2", ..., "Stadium_8".
  Arenas have "directors", "Director_1, .., Director_9" (but no capacities).
  Stadiums have "capacities" (but no directors), where capacity of Stadium_i is i000, e.g., Stadium 2 has capacity 2000.
  Finally, both arenas and venues have information about which cities they are located in.
  Arena_i is in City_i and Venue_j is in City_j. Cities are located in states, State_i, which are located in Country_i.
  Think of City_i, City_j, and State_i as the names of these cities, states, and countries and if you prefer you can add a "name" or .
  In the end, you will have 9 different Cities that are located in 9 different states, which are further located in 9 different countries. 
- **Players:** Each club Club_i has 3 players. Player_i_1,...,Player_i_3. 
  Players have "wages" and "joinDates"; specifically Player_i_j has a wage of ij and has joined his/her team in year 19ij.
  So Player_1_3 has a wage of 13 and has joined his team in year 1913 (don't worry about this not being realistic,
  we are only trying to give a structure to the database). Similarly Player_9_3 has joined in year 1993.

*Note about base namespace:* For any resource or property you define in this database, use the IRI: `https://teamportsdb/`. 
For example, if you are modeling the names of clubs with a predicate called  "clubname", make the IRI of the predicate:  `https://teamportsdb/clubname`.

### Individual Sports Database:
This database stores information about the following entities:

- **Individual Sports:** There are 9 individual sports ISport_1,...,ISport_9. 
- **Atheletes:** There are 18 athletes, Athlete_1_1, Athlete_1_2, Athlete_2_1, Athlete_2_2, ..., Athlete_9_1, Athlete_9_2.
  Athlete_i_{1/2} participates in ISport_i. Athelete_i_j has name "Sunny_i_j" and an age ji and is a citizen of country Country_i.
  So Athlete_3_1 is 13 years old and is a citizen of Country_3 and Athlete_9_2 is 29 years old and is a citizen of Country_9.

*Note about base namespace: For any resource or property you define in this database, use the IRI: `https://indsportsdb/`.*

## Integrated database
After designing the above 2 individual databases, your next goal is to integrate these databases (so the same triples) in a single database. Obviously the simplest approach is to just put both triples into the same database. Note that, the Team Sports and Individual Sport databases are separate databases and the IRIs you should use for them have different base namespaces, so there is no common IRI across these datasets. However some of the entities are the same. Further you may want to tie up the classes you have defined together into one hierarchy to answer some of the queries we are interested in. The equalities are as follows:

- Athlete_i_1 is the same person as Player_i_1. 
- Country_i in Team Sports database is the same as Country_i in Individual sports database.


## Queries:
You should submit your queries in a `queries.py` Python script with q1(...), ..., q6(...) functions which return SPARQL queries (so just string queries) that answer the below questions. Each query may need some arguments, which are detailed below. In your queries, do not exploit the structure of the database we described above. For example, for the first query below, which asks to find all teammates of Player_i_j, say Player_1_1, do not write a query that uses CASE statements to directly match Player_1_2 and Player_1_3. For example, you query cannot look like:
```
def q1(i, j) :
...
if (i = 1 and j = 1) {
return
    """
    SELECT DISTINCT ?p WHERE {
        ?x ?y <https://teamportsdb/Player_1_2> .
        ?w ?z  <https://teamportsdb/Player_1_2> .
    }
    """  
}
```

- Q1: Find all teammates of Player_i_j. Write a function q1(i, j) in your Python queries script that takes in an i and j and produces the SPARQL query that answers the given question.
- Q2: Find all sports played in a particular State_i. Your function could have signature q2(i).
- Q3: Find all sports played by Player_i_j. Your function could have signature q3(i, j).
- Q4: Find all venues (so stadiums or arenas) in Country_i. Your function could have signature q4(i).
- Q5: What are the ages of players with wages > x. Your function could have signature q5(x). The answer can be null for some players and non-null for others.
- Q6: Find all individual sports athletes who are from a country that has a stadium with capacity > x. Your function could have signature q6(x). 

# Information about OntoText GraphDB Free Edition

You should work on OntoText GraphDB. You can download it [here](https://www.ontotext.com/products/graphdb/download/). I advise going through one of the "Star Wars" or "The Movies" database guides on the landing page of their main interface once you launch GraphDB Desktop program (see the "Take me to the guides" section).

Important functionality you will need are: 
1) How to create repositories (think of these as new databases):
Here the important part is that under "Setup->Repositories" (see attached screenshot), click "Create new repository". Then click "Create GraphDB repository".

Then if you want GraphDB to do automatic reasoning using OWL statements, pick a Ruleset. You can pick "OWL-RL (Optimized)" Ruleset and I think most of the owl predicates you might use in your modeling (e.g., owl:sameAs) should work.

3) How to import triple files (n-triples (.nt) or Turtle (.ttl)) files: 
You can read documentation about these formats here: [n-triples](https://www.w3.org/TR/n-triples/) and [Turtle](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/).

4) How to write SPARQL queries: 
Click the "SPARQL" tab on GraphDB's left panel. There are tabs you can open to write multiple queries and test their results as shown below.

# What to submit
Submit the following documents:

1) The `queries.py` Python script that has the 6 queries above in functions q1(...), ..., q6(...).
2) The Turtle or n-triples files for your Team Sports, Individual Sports, and the integrated database. You should also submit the scripts you used to generate these databases.
3) The main submission is a README document that answers the following questions:
	- Individual Database Design: For each of the two databases: explain how you modeled each entity and relationship. What were the Resources, IRIs that you picked, what were the `rdf:type`'s of your entities and the class hierarchies you picked? Did you use any RDFS or OWL predicate (e.g., `owl:SymmetricProperty` or `owl:TransitiveProperty` or `rdfs:subClassOf`)? What were the final triples you generated? Explain the reasoning behind your choices. 
	- Integrated Database Design: Explain what you did to integrate the two databases? What were the new triples that you added and any modifications you did to the existing triples in these databases.
 	- Queries: For each query, explain which inference capabilities of RDFS or OWL did you use? Show example triples that GraphDB automatically inferred.
  	- Comparison with a Cypher-based implementation: Imagine that you were tasked to design the similar databases in the property graph model and how you would integrate. Briefly, what would your general approach be? What would be the similarities of your approach to to your RDF design and what would be the differences? How would your queries differ? I'm looking for a two, three paragraph discussion here.

In the README document, have a new subsection for each of these question.
